Launch a networked REPL server on one machine and connect to it from
another machine or process.

## Server

@codeblock[janet]```
(import spork/netrepl)

(def some-def 10)

# Serve a repl into the current environment (@code`some-def` will be visible).
(netrepl/server "127.0.0.1" "9000" (fiber/getenv (fiber/current)))
```

## Client

@codeblock[janet]```
(import spork/netrepl)

# Starts a nice terminal repl.
(netrepl/client "127.0.0.1" "9000" "bob")
```
