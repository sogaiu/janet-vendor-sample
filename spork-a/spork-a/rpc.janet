# RPC Protocol
#
# All prodcedure calls must be accompanied by a nonce value. This can be any non-repeating
# value that is unique per-connection - a sequence of increasing integers works well.
#
# 1. server <- {user specified name of client} <- client
# 2. server -> {marshalled tuple of supported keys in marshal dict (capabilites)} -> client
# 3. server <- {marshalled function call: [nonce fnname args]} <- client
# 4. server -> {result of unmarshalled call: [nonce status result]} -> client
# 5. go back to 3.
