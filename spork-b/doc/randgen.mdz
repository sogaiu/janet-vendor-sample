A small utility for random number generation, especially with a focus on
discrete numbers. The most powerful idea here is the ability to have branches
that execute in a probabilistic manner - i.e. one branch is taken half the time
randomly, and another is taken otherwise.

@codeblock[janet]```
# Print either a, b, or c
(import spork/randgen)
(randgen/rand-path
  (print "a")
  (print "b")
  (print "c"))
```
