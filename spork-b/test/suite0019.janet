# TODO: This tests the reduced set of codepoints based on the original set in
# Bestline:
# https://github.com/jart/bestline/blob/4a09bf4355c15c96526/bestline.c#L274-L287
# Some ranges have carveouts in them to account for unallocated characters or
# unusual ones (U+302A and such) in blocks that the Bestline conditional treats
# as monolithic for simplification's sake.
