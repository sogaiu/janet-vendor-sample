The @code`http` module is an HTTP/1.1 parser, server and client module. It proves a simple server implementation, client, support for chunked encoding.
The @code`http` module is also non-blocking, so a single thread can run
many clients, servers, and connections at once.

## Server

@codeblock[janet]```
(import spork/http)

(defn handler
 [req]
 (def method (get req :method))
 (case method
  "GET" {:status 200 :body (get req :path)}
  "POST" {:status 400 :body (http/read-body req)}
  {:status 404}))

(http/server handler "127.0.0.1" "9000")
```

## Client

@codeblock[janet]```
(import spork/http)

(def response (http/request "GET" "http://www.example.com"))
(def body (http/read-body response))
(print body)
```
