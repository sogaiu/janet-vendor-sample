Provide a symmetric way to send and receive seqential messages over a
networked stream.  Useful for building more complicated application
level protocols on top of TCP.

@codeblock[janet]```
(import spork/msg)

(def stream (net/connect "http://example.com" "1234"))

(def send (msg/make-send stream))
(def recv (msg/make-recv stream))

(send "blob1")
(def blob-respose (recv))
```
